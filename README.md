# landing-page
My first landing page :)

--- 29 Dec 2023 ---
1. Managed to come up with a skeletal for the website
2. Referenced from the exercises done on flex. This gave me a good concept on how the html and css work when using flex :)

Managed to finish my landing page. Alhamdullilah. May this be a launchpad for greater things.
1. Cross referenced to the flex assignments --> solidified concepts.
2. asked around in Discord and Shahied to verify certain css and html concepts
3. containerising using <div>
4. using border css styles to have a better view of the containers.
